	Coffee is a versitile drink! It can be brewed and consumed in quite a few ways, and while there
	isn't necessarily a wrong way, there are a few best practices to observe to create
	a cup of competence. Understanding the roast, grind, and brew method for your beans 
	can make the difference between a casual or choice cup of joe.

			<p> There are several brew methods, all with their own equipment, 
			grind, water, and skill prerequisites. Usually, hot water is dispensed
			to soak ground coffee and is filtered by a metal or paper filter. 
			Drip, pour-over, French press, and espresso brewing methods all employ
			this strategy to some degree. Iced coffee is normally brewed hot and 
			to later be iced, but cold brew’s cycle uniquely begins and ends with 
			cold water, keeping acidity minimal. However you choose to enjoy it, 
			coffee’s a labor of love that requires time and care.</p>

			<p> Grind size is pivotal in achieving an ideal flavor profile
			for any brewing method. Each type of brew has a specific texture
			to alter the way water interacts with the coffee taste. For example,
			pour-overs require a medium grind, which allows an even flow of water
			to moisten the grounds, producing balanced and rich notes. The size 
			of the grounds also changes how long the coffee brews for. The finer
			the grind, the quicker the brew. Coarser-textured grinds need additional
			time to soak, and if the timing consistency is absent, the cup can 
			become weak or sour. </p>

			<p>Coffee can be endlessly customized to personal taste. This beverage 
			is enjoyed hot, iced, and blended to name a few. The taste can be sweetened
			by sugar, honey, or flavored syrups. Dairy or plant-based creamers can 
			add richness and texture to the cup. Cinnamon, nutmeg, or cayenne elevates
			the flavor profile further. For an indulgent twist, whipped cream or sprinkles
			can spice it up. Coffee can be crafted to meet the dietary needs and seasonal 
			cravings of just about anyone.  </p>
