	Coffee is a versitile drink! It can be brewed quite a few ways, and while there
	isn't necessarily a wrong way, there are a few best practices to observe to create
	a cup of competence. Understanding the origin, roast, and brew method for your beans 
	can make the difference between a casual or choice cup of joe.

			<p> Drip brewing is one of the most common methods, where
			hot water slowly passes through ground coffee in a paper
			or metal filter. Pour-over methods offer more control 
			over brewing time and water flow, resulting in a nuanced,
			aromatic brew. French press uses immersion brewing: coffee
			grounds steep in hot water before being separated by pressing 
			a metal mesh plunger. Espresso forces hot water through 
			finely ground coffee under high pressure, creating a concentrated
			shot with crema. Other styles include cold brewing, which is
			steeping coffee cold water for hours, and Moka pot, a stovetop
			method producing strong, espresso-like coffee.</p>

			<p>The grind size of coffee is crucial to achieving the ideal
			flavor and extraction for each brewing method. Different brewing
			styles require specific grind textures to control how water 
			interacts with the coffee. For example, pour-over methods benefit
			from a medium grind, allowing water to flow evenly and extract nuanced
			notes. Grind size also affects brew time: finer grinds extract flavor quickly,
			while coarser ones need longer contact with water. Using the wrong grind can 
			lead to bitter, sour, or weak coffee. Consistency matters too—uneven grinds 
			cause imbalanced flavors.</p>

			<p>Coffee offers endless ways to tailor it to personal taste.
			Sweeteners like sugars, honey, or flavored syrups add depth, 
			while dairy or plant-based creamers adjust richness and texture.
			Seasonings like cinnamon, nutmeg, or even a dash of cayenne can 
			elevate the flavor profile. For a more indulgent twist, whipped
			cream or indulgent sprinkles can be added to spice up your cup. 
			Coffee can be crafted to match dietary needs or seasonal cravings alike. </p>
