	Curious About Coffee?
	</h2>
	<p style="color: #FFFFFF">
	As one of the world’s most beloved beverages, coffee has energizing effects, a delicious aroma, and 
	the customizability consumers love. The coffee bean originates from the Coffea plant and after being 
	picked, processed, roasted, and put on the market, it becomes the drink that has been fueling mornings
	around the globe.

			<p>The Coffee Belt is the preferred climate for the Coffea plant. It’s a tropical zone that 
			includes parts of Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. In these regions, humidity,
			soil, and weather conditions consistently support healthy coffee plants and cherries, which are the
			most valuable part of the trees for production. Altitude also significantly influences 
			flavor, giving each area unique characteristics. Farmers in these regions are masters of their craft,
			harvesting and maintaining the plant's finiky lifestyle. </p>

			<p>Although a multitude of variations exist, there are four main types of coffee plants:
			Arabica, Robusta, Liberia, and Excelsa, though the first two are the most widely known. 
			Each has distinct flavors, growing requirements, and cultural significance to its country
			of origin. Arabica accounts for over half of the beans sold at retail stores, since it has
			a mild profile and smoother body. Robusta is reserved for those looking for a heftier delivery
			of both boldness and caffeine, like espresso roasts.</p>

	<br>		

			<p>Coffee roasts’ flavor, body, and scent profile can all be determined by how long the
			beans are roasted for. Three categories or identifiers that fit nearly all the coffee roasts
			of the world are light, medium, and dark roasts. Light roasts have a higher acidity but offer
			a gentle and subtle flavor of cinnamon and citrus. Dark roasts are known for their smooth but
			bold taste that hints of smokiness and caramel, thanks to the roasting process. Medium roasts 
			are the middle ground, offering the best of both worlds and delivering a decent amount of caffeine.</p>
