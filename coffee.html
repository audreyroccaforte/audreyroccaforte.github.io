	<p style="color: #FFFFFF">
	Coffee is one of the world's most beloved beverages, known for its rich aroma
	and energizing effects. It originates from the seeds of the Coffea plant, and 
	eventually becomes the liquid gold that fuels mornings around the globe. Here,
	you can learn more about the origins of coffee, the plants's preferred climate, and
	different types and roast options.

			<p>The coffee belt is a tropical zone encircling the globe that encompasses parts of Central
			and South America, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. This region provides the
			ideal climate for growing Coffea plants, with consistent rainfall, moderate
			temperatures, rich soil, and high humidity. Altitude within the coffee belt plays a crucial
			role in flavor development. The coffee belt isn’t just a geographic zone—it’s the heart of
			global coffee culture, sustaining millions of farmers and fueling a worldwide passion.</p>

			<p>The four main types of coffee plants—Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, and Excelsa. Each
			offer distinct flavors, growing conditions, and cultural significance. Arabica (Coffea arabica)
			is the most popular, accounting for about 60–70% of global coffee production. Grown at high 
			altitudes in cooler climates, it produces smooth, aromatic beans with mild acidity and complex 
			flavor profiles. Robusta (Coffea canephora) is hardier and grows at lower elevations. It contains more caffeine
			and has a stronger, more bitter taste, often used in espresso blends for its crema and punch.</p>

			<p>Coffee roasts differ in flavor, aroma, and body based on how long the beans are roasted. 
			The three main categories are light, medium, and dark roasts.Light tend to have higher acidity and showcase
			subtle, often fruity or floral notes. Medium roasts offer a balanced profile with moderate acidity 
			and a fuller body. The roasting process caramelizes sugars, producing a smoother taste with hints 
			of chocolate or nuts. Dark roasts are roasted longer, resulting in bold, smoky flavors and low acidity. 
			Choosing the right roast depends on your desired flavor experience.</p>
